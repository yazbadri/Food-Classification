# Food Classifier CNN

### Can a machine correctly classify food images?

This project began with great ambitiions and quickly had to humble itself after spending 2 entire days running one very large dataset through a model which sadly achieved just 9% accuracy. It began as a food identifier for a dataset with 101 classes with 1000 images in each class for a total of 101,000 images. The images in the dataset are not high quality, and are mostly taken on phones, as they would if this was being used in an app. In order to figure out how to get a better score on our entire dataset, we decided to start much smaller and with much less classes and go from there.

## EDA

We started with performing a very brief EDA on our data for each iteration of the project. We used an image data generator which pulls the images in from the given directory by batches and resizes it to the size we need all the images to be. Next, we separated our images and labels into X and y and turned them into numpy arrays for both training and testing, and rescaled our data pixels to be between 0-1 which keeps our range of weights in a small range. In order to check our images and make sure they looked ready to be put into the model, we displayed a grid of the images from our processed data.

## Modeling: Part 1

Since we are modeling image classification, we decided to use Google's Tensorflow Keras library with Convolutional Neural Networks and pre-trained model weights. Each convolutional layer has a number of filters that are moved over each image and features are extracted by importance using a formula of weights and biases on each pixel. These models are considered to be unsupervised, as the model itself is doing its own work beneath the surface, which we don't have much say about. With unsupervised machine learning, in order to improve model performance we can change our inputs and our hyperparameters, but the model will be doing the heavy lifting.

Using the Food-5k dataset which has 2 classes: food and not-food, we were able to achieve 100% fairly quickly. We started out with a simple FFNN model which didn't perform so well, getting around 60-70% accuracy, but this was just to have something to compare to our CNN model. We built our CNN with only two convolution layers and pooling layers and 5 dense layers, a batch size of 32 and 40 epochs. Our CNN reached 90.62% at its best. After doing some research on which models perform best on images, we found many pretrained model weights which can be used for transfer learning. After trying out several of them, we found that (as research had stated) the Xception pre-trained model performs best on our data. By using the Xception CNN, which has 22M parameters and 36 convolutional layers, we quickly raised our best score to 100%.

## Modeling: Part 2

Moving on from our Food-5k, we turned back to our original dataset, Food-11, but this time we subsetted the classes by categories in order to start with just a small subset of classes and go up from there. We started with a subset of 4 classes under the Seafood category we created, with the classes: oysters, mussels, sashimi, and scallops. We ran the same Xception model that we used for the Food-5k dataset and achieved 100% training accuracy but 78% validation accuracy which meant our model was pretty overfit. After doing some more research we found that using data augmentation might help boost our model performance. Data augmentation is a method of supplementing image data by using methods of creating new images to train on from the original images in the dataset. Using this method, we were able to raise our accuracy for validation to 100%.

## Modeling: Part 3

Next, we wanted to use a larger subset to train our model on, so we used a subset we called Desserts, which contained 20 classes for 20,000 total images. We ran the same models on them, but even after making several changes to the parameters, our best scores were 18.75% for the Xception model without data augmentation and 60.2% for the model with data augmentation. It seems the more classes a dataset has, the more difficult it is to train the model and get a good model performance.

## Conclusions

After running numerous different CNN models with different hyperparameters and different amounts of images and classes, we've learned the following:

Preprocessing:
Image data should be preprocessed before modeling
Images should be resized to each be the same size and shape
Turning the images into numpy arrays and normalizing the data points to be between 0-1 minimizes the data sizes going into the models which speeds up the model runtime without losing preformance.
Data augmentation greatly boosts the model performance, since it adds many more images for the model to train on.
Models
Using a model with pre-trained weights such as Xception helps boost model performance without as much time trying many different layers with a custom model.
Hyperparameters should match the type of data and number of classes being predicted. We used the 'softmax' activator in our final layer which works best for predicting more than 2 classes, and we used SGD for our optimizer which we found gave us the best and most reliable model performance.
Using an optimizer with a scheduled learning rate helps boost performance as the learning rate is minimized exponentially over the steps of the model.
The more classes there are to predict, the more difficult it will be for the model to perform well since the data is basically diluted. The more classes there are, the more images you will need in each class to make up for the dilution.
Conclusions
Our initial model with just 2 classes was fairly quickly able to get 100% accuracy on both training and testing using a fairly simple CNN. After changing our data to a dataset with 3 classes, we were able to get up to 96% accuracy using an Xception CNN model. At 4 classes, we dropped to about 81% accuracy using the same model. When we tried to use the same model on a dataset of 20 classes, we found the model performed exponentially worse and very overfit with 100% training accuracy but an abismal 21% validation accuracy.

After some research, we added data augmentation and reran the Xception model with much better success. Our model was no longer overfit, but only achieved up to 64% accuracy for the validation data.

## Future Recommendations

Running each model with data augmentation (and larger datasets in general) takes 1-2 hours, even when running on GPUs which is to say that this project in it's entirety will be time-consuming. In order to achieve a better model performance, more time needs to be taken to find more ways to improve upon our current models or try different models such as PyTorch. Some things that can be done to improve upon the model are adding more image data from other food image datasets to supplement our existing data, trying different preprocessing methods, stacking models, or possibly even building a model from scratch which would require more time to test run and rerun.

This project could serve as a basis for other projects such as:

Classifying food portion sizes
Predicting food calories or nutrional value based on food in image + food portions
Food segmentation, such as food quality segmentation for industrial food separating and packaging
AI for food service industry such as food service robots or food prep robots
